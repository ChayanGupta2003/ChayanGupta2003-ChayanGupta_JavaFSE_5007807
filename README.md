Exercise 1: Employee Management System - Overview and Setup

Initialize a Spring Boot project named EmployeeManagementSystem with dependencies: Spring Data JPA, H2 Database, Spring Web, and Lombok. Configure application.properties for H2 database connection using the provided settings.
Exercise 2: Employee Management System - Creating Entities

Define JPA entities for Employee and Department with appropriate fields and relationships. Use annotations like @Entity and @Table to map entities to database tables, and establish a one-to-many relationship between Department and Employee.
Exercise 3: Employee Management System - Creating Repositories

Create EmployeeRepository and DepartmentRepository interfaces extending JpaRepository for CRUD operations. Define derived query methods to leverage Spring Data repositories for efficient data management.
Exercise 4: Employee Management System - Implementing CRUD Operations

Implement basic CRUD operations using JpaRepository methods. Develop RESTful endpoints in EmployeeController and DepartmentController to manage employees and departments.
Exercise 5: Employee Management System - Defining Query Methods

Enhance repositories with custom queries using method names and the @Query annotation. Define and execute named queries with @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries for specialized data retrieval.
Exercise 6: Employee Management System - Implementing Pagination and Sorting

Add pagination to employee search functionality using Page and Pageable. Incorporate sorting capabilities and combine pagination with sorting in search endpoints to improve data retrieval.
Exercise 7: Employee Management System - Enabling Entity Auditing

Enable entity auditing to track creation and modification of employees and departments. Use annotations like @CreatedBy, @LastModifiedBy, @CreatedDate, and @LastModifiedDate for auditing purposes.
Exercise 8: Employee Management System - Creating Projections

Create interface-based and class-based projections to fetch specific data subsets from entities. Use @Value and constructor expressions to customize the data returned by projections.
Exercise 9: Employee Management System - Customizing Data Source Configuration

Customize data source configuration and manage multiple data sources. Leverage Spring Boot auto-configuration and externalize settings in application.properties for flexible data source management.
Exercise 10: Employee Management System - Hibernate-Specific Features

Utilize Hibernate-specific annotations to optimize entity mappings. Configure Hibernate dialect and properties for performance, and implement batch processing for efficient bulk operations.
